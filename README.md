# parser-example
 
Created a new programming language and implemented its parser, lexer and semantic analyser. The programming language is used to move a robot around a warehouse with different possibilities, such as moving boxes and fixing outlets. Several more advanced elements were added, such as support for recursive functions (check out the examples tp*.py).
